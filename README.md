## Manual Installation

!!! You need [Bepinex 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest) for mono !!!
(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2 and it might work. maybe)

Once bepinex is installed, put the dll into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.

NOTE: Versions < 2.x.x require bepinex 6.0.0-pre2. I don't know why you'd be using an old version but if you are you need to install that instead of bepinex 5

have fun :3
